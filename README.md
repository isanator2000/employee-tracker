# Employee tracker

## Description
The employee tracker is a command-line application for managing a company's employees. It uses node, inquirer, and MySQL.
It's important to mention that it's still a WIP as I haven't been able to fix some issues, so it doesn't fully work (you can see that in the demo, as I get stuck in the end and I'm unable to continue logging data).
